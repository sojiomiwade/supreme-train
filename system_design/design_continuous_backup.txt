C daemon makes write requests via thrift API calls to C++ ingestion service
metadata is managed via Scala service API calls, relayed from the C++ ingestion service
d: on migration, estabilish connection to backup service on ip?
---
daemon is simple logic: manage I/O with concurrency, so can't put logic there
need it to instead hit the service
---
solution: metadata service can request vcenter to provide the migration info



python vs other languages. what do you think for dbaas?
